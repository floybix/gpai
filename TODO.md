# TODO



## methods

* icgp
  * currently performs worse than cgp. needs creative destruction?
    * rather than atrophying Least Recently Used, discard a random one
    * and any (downstream) dependencies.
  * nodes in a map, not a vector.
  * globally unique ids: allows merging genomes!

* ecgp

* cgp ~crossover/merge by swallowing other genome as a function codebase?
  * or adopt dominant strategies as global function codebases
  * automatically defined _closures_ (override some args only)

* island populations

* mutation or optimisation to adjust numeric constants


## misc

* cgp consistency with icgp
  * node last-used accounting?

* pre / post / assertions

* use expresso to simplify evolved arithmetic expressions
  * specify rules for language sets


## problems

* santa fe trail ant

* random number generators
  * visualise evolution progress
  * dominance tournament

* three-way coevolution:
  * overseer / goodies / baddies
  * challenge + response
  * (generalise coevolve?)

* game of life vs death
  * game of life, torus
  * divide initial grid between life vs death
  * if any non-repetitive activity after N steps, life wins

* spikes

* sumobots

* submarine?

* learning
  * hunt the wumpus
