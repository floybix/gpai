# gpai

Genetic Programming for Artificial Intelligence. _[n. jee-pai]_

A Clojure library.

Not ready to be used by anyone except me (yet)...

This is designed for problems where the evolved program will be
executed many times in one individual evaluation. An example is a
program controlling robot movement at each time step. It will be
inefficient on toy problems common in the GP literature such as
*parity* or *symbolic regression* where each individual program is
evaluated only once (due to compilation and other overheads).
