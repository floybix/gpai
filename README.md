# gpai

Genetic Programming for Artificial Intelligence. _[n. jee-pai]_

A Clojure library.

Not ready to be used by anyone except me (yet)...

This is intended for problems where the fitness function dominates the
computation time. An example is a program controlling robot movement
at each time step. It will be inefficient on toy problems common in
the GP literature such as *parity* or *symbolic regression* where each
individual program is evaluated only once (due to compilation and
other overheads).
